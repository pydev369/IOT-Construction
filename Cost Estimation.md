# Drone Solution for Construction Industry

This project proposes the use of drones equipped with object detection and face recognition technology to improve safety, quality control, and resources utilization on construction sites. The drones will be able to detect potential hazards, monitor resources usage, and report any SOP violations in real-time to a central server.

## Technical Stack

The proposed technical stack for this project includes the following:

- Python for the development of drone software
- OpenCV for object detection and face recognition
- Raspberry Pi 4 as the drone's main computer
- Pi Camera for image and video capture
- DJI Tello drone for testing and prototyping

## Drone Options and Cost Estimates

The following table lists some low-cost drone options available in India that can be used for testing and prototyping:

| Model | Features | Approx. Cost (INR) | Suitability for Construction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DJI Tello | 720p camera, 13 min flight time, 100 m range | 12,000 | Suitable for testing and prototyping |
| Syma X5SW | 720p camera, 7 min flight time, 50 m range | 5,000 | Suitable for testing and prototyping |
| JJRC H68 | 720p camera, 20 min flight time, 100 m range | 6,500 | Suitable for testing and prototyping |

## Cost Estimation

The following is an estimated cost breakdown for the MVP drone solution:

### Hardware

- DJI Tello drone: INR 12,000
- Raspberry Pi 4: INR 4,000
- Pi Camera: INR 1,500
